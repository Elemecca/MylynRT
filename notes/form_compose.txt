@lib/RT/Interface/REST.pm:191

takes an array (ref) of forms
for each form, the output text is collected as described below
the form output blocks are then joined with '\n--\n\n'

if a comment block ($c) is present, it is output first
any trailing blank lines are removed
a single blank line is appended

if an error block ($e) is present, it is output verbatim
otherwise, if a key set ($o) is present, the KVPs are written (see below)
otherwise any trailing whitespace is removed

multi-line values will be written on their own, preceded and followed by a blank line
each line after the first is indented to line up with the first content column in the first line
however, if that would be more than 16 columns, they are indented four columns instead

successive single-line values will be concatenated into a comma-space separated list
if the appending a value would make the current line at least 70 columns,
a comma will be added in the last column of the current line
	and the value will be output on the next line
wrapped lists behave exactly like multi-line values
